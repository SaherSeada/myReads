# MyReads Project

This is the first project for the Advance Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. It's about creating a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library. The starter template had the HTML and CSS files and I had to add the React code.
